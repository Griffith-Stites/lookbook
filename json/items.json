        "name": "SIR Model",
        "description": "I worked with a partner to study the correlation between sleep and the spread of disease. We created a SIR (Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered) model to simulate the spread of disease through a population sample. We used python to build this model. Pictured is a prediction of an outbreak on Olin's campus (left). The result was generated from our model using sleep data from an Olin student survey. On the right is a simulated disease with all students getting an extra hour of sleep. The green line represents the recovered population, the orange line represents the susceptible population, and the blue line represents the infected population.

        "description": "I designed and installed a patch network for use in the Networking, Integration, and Automation (NIA) lab. This included project planning, running team meetings, scheduling, managing material lists, and managing a budget. The project came in on time and under budget. In total, the project involved 21 separate racks which had Ethernet, single-mode fiber, 62.5Âµm multi-mode fiber, GPS signal, and IRIG clock signal connections. The project will save hundreds of engineering hours in the future as it makes connecting different devices across the lab fast, neat, and easy.",

        "description": "I educated over 200 high school students about the importance of accepting and recognizing diversity, specifically in reference to LGBTQ and gender diversity. My presentation focused on my journey discovering my sexuality and gender expression. I used story telling strategies, humor, and activities to engage students. I received great feedback from the presentation, including a number of LGBTQ students who found the presentation inspiring and helpful.",

The pictured robot was the final design and competed in the 2018 FRC competition: Power Up. The robot was undefeated in qualifications and ranked number one at the Iowa regional.",

        "description": "I worked as the Electrical Lead for the design of Silver, as well as serving as the Drive Coach at competitions. Silver used a drive train new to our team: Swerve. Swerve utilizes four wheels which are able to be independently turned 360 degrees. I worked to solve the new and challenging electrical and programming challenges which came with this new drive train. Examples of these challenges included accurately measuring wheel position and maintaining robot orientation. Silver won the Iowa regional and made it to the world competition.",

        "description": "I designed, machined, assembled, and programmed this Macropad. It is a completely custom design which is optimized to my own work flow. This photo is also representative of my greater obsession with work flow. I build my own custom keyboards, create custom keyboard layouts, type in Dvorak (A more efficient keyboard layout), and use a variety of different programs and desktop environments (Where appropriate) to optimize my work on computers.",
