                <p class="resource">TERFs are shit and their opinions are not valid. They are tranpshobic and use their cis privelege to make the lives of trans people harder. They appropriate feminist arguments as a way to justify their views. Their views hurt women and trans people. The only valid form of feminism is an intersectional one.</p>

                <p class="resource">Discusses the different types of transphobia and helps to provide distinctions between different transphobic positions. Also helps to explain that many transphobic feminists are not TERFs, and just are trans-unaware. This provided me hope for the future of trans rights and feminism.</p>

                <p class="resource">Explains why being a sexual assault is not an excuse for being transphobic. This includes why it is innappropriate to misgender trans people, particularly trans women, and why not having relations with a trans woman simply because she has a penis is wrong and transphobic.</p>

                <p class="resource">Argues against transphobic "feminism" arguments. Although I believe it gives too much credibility to transphobic "feminism", I think this helps it reach more audiences.</p>

                <p class="resource">Ironically, TERFs are offended by being called cis while proceeding to harass and use slurs to describe trans people. This article explains why cis is a word all about helping trans people and is in no way meant to make cis people feel bad.</p>
                <a href="https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/10/trans-women-male-privilege/">Still Think Trans Women Have Male Privilege? These 7 Points Prove They Don’t</a>
                <p class="resource">I do not agree with all of the things the author has to say, but they bring up good points in explaining why trans women do not have male privilege.<br>
                My personal view is that I have experienced some privilege and opportunities by living the first 18 years of my life identifying and presenting as a man, though I think this experience is distinctly different than male privilege. I internalized societal messages directed at women as applying to myself. My experience being treated as male was extremely different than those of a cisgender boy. I was terrified and felt awful being treated this way, instead of being empowered by it.<br>Regardless of privilege, solidarity between all women - and trans women are women - is important and necessary.</p>

                <p class="resource">I am not a huge fan of either of these articles about genital preference, yet I have not found anything better yet. They give too much credibility to genial preference in my opinion and let societal transphobic beliefs bleed through in the writing.</p>
